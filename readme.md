### Blueprint (optional)

If you want to see the votes in the panel you can add this to your blueprint:

```text
fields:
  likes: likes
  dislikes: dislikes
```

If you don't want to use the built in global field definitions you can use the alternative:

```
fields:
  likes:
    title: Likes
    type: text
    width: 1/2
  dislikes:
    title: Dislikes
    type: text
    width: 1/2
```

## Options

The following options can be set in your `/site/config/config.php` file:

```php
c::set('plugin.nja.blocked.ips', []);
c::set('plugin.nja.definitions', true);
c::get('plugin.nja.methods', true);
c::get('plugin.nja.snippet', 'nja');
c::get('plugin.nja.panel.page', 'nja');
```

### blocked.ips (optional)

If you want to block some ips from being able to vote you can add them as an array.

### definitions (optional)

Activate the plugin field definitions. Read more about it in Usage/Blueprint.

### methods (optional)

Enable or disable the plugin page methods.

### snippet (optional)

Set the name of the built in snippet when calling it. If set to false it will not set it at all.

### panel.page (optional)

All likes/dislikes will be saved as files in a subfolder to the page to keep track on IP numbers to prevent multiple votes from the same visitor. It's possible to use a custom name for this page.
