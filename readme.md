If you know your way around Git, you can download this plugin as a submodule:

```
$ cd path/to/kirby
$ git submodule add https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-nja site/plugins/kirby-nja
```

## Setup

### Css

If you don't have an own css file, add the following code to your `header.php` snippet:

```php
echo css('assets/plugins/kirby-nja/css/style.min.css');
```

**The `nja-loading` class**

By default the class `nja-loading` is not used, but if you want a loading indicator of some kind you can use this class.

### Javascript

Add the following code to your `footer.php` snippet:

```php
<?php echo js('assets/plugins/kirby-nja/js/dist/script.min.js'); ?>
<script>
nja.init({root: '<?php echo u(); ?>'});
</script>
```

**Callback (optional)**

If you need to do something when the like/dislike is saved you can use a callback:

```js
nja.init({
  root: '<?php echo u(); ?>',
  ajaxCallback: function(item, group, args) {
    console.log(args);
  }
});
```

- `group` is the button group object.
- `item` is the clicked button object.
- `args` is an array with data. Use the `console.log` to see what it contains.

### Snippet

Use the built in snippet or build you own. The built in snippet can be disabled by an option, or overwritten by your own with the same name.

```php
snippet('nja');
snippet('nja', ['page' => $page_object]);
```

## Usage

Text, images and videos are good things to describe how to use this plugin.

### Blueprint (optional)

If you want to see the votes in the panel you can add this to your blueprint:

```text
fields:
  nja:
    title: Likes/dislikes
    type: nja
```

## Options

The following options can be set in your `/site/config/config.php` file:

```php
c::set('plugin.nja.blocked.ips', []);
c::get('plugin.nja.dislikes.key', 'dislikes');
c::get('plugin.nja.likes.key', 'likes');
c::get('plugin.nja.panel.uri', 'panel');
c::get('plugin.tja.records.page.slug', 'nja');
c::get('plugin.tja.records.page.title', '_Nja');
c::get('plugin.nja.snippet', 'nja');
```

### blocked.ips (optional)

If you want to block some ips from being able to vote you can add them as an array.

### dislikes.key (optional)

The content key for the dislikes counter.

### likes.key (optional)

The content key for the likes counter.

### panel.uri (optional)

If you don't have the panel installed at `/panel` you need to use this option for the `nja` field to work. If you don't use the field it does not matter.

### records.page.slug (optional)

All likes/dislikes will be saved as files in a subfolder to the page to keep track on IP numbers to prevent multiple votes from the same visitor. It's possible to use a custom name for this page.

### records.page.title (optional)

The title for the likes/dislikes records panel page.

### snippet (optional)

Set the name of the built in snippet when calling it. If set to `false` it will not set it at all.
